# Day 3
    A brief description of managing data and hooks.

### Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components in React
    When dealing with form inputs in React, there are two ways to manage the values:

        - Controlled Components: React controls the input value using state.
        - Uncontrolled Components: The DOM controls the input value using ref.

### Log File
    A log file is a file that records events, messages, or errors generated by software, applications, servers, or systems. It helps in debugging, monitoring, and analyzing system behavior.

    A log file typically contains:
        Timestamps 📅 (When the event happened)
        Log Level 🚦 (Severity like INFO, ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG)
        Messages 📝 (Details about the event)
        Source 🖥️ (Which system/app generated it)

    Terminal: npm i winston

### React Lifecycle
    The React Lifecycle refers to the different phases a React component goes through from creation to destruction. These phases help manage how a component is initialized, updated, and removed.

    Mounting --> Updating (Re-rendering) --> Unmounting (Component Removal)
